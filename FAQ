# Frequently Asked Questions

### How do I open your Scratch projects?

First, click the .sb3 file for the project you want to open, then click the Download button over on the right. Now you've downloaded the file, but how do we open it?

Well, the projects I've shared here so far cannot be opened in regular Scratch - they use features exclusive to [TurboWarp](https://turbowarp.org/), a Scratch mod, so open [TurboWarp](https://turbowarp.org/) and then load the project into it.

### Can I use your work in my projects?

Absolutely!

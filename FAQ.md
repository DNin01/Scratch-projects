# Frequently Asked Questions

### What is Scratch?

Scratch is a coding language and online community where you can create your own interactive stories, games, and animations -- and share your creations with others around the world. As young people create and share Scratch projects, they learn to think creatively, reason systematically, and work collaboratively. Scratch is a project of the [Scratch Foundation](https://www.scratchfoundation.org/) in collaboration with the Lifelong Kindergarten group at the MIT Media Lab. It is available for free at https://scratch.mit.edu.

### How do I open your Scratch projects?

From the GitHub website, navigate to the .sb3 file for the project you want to open, then click the Download button, which should be over on the right.

Alternatively, clone this repository and extract the file from the cloned repository.

Now you've downloaded the file, but how do we open it? Well, the projects I've shared here so far cannot be opened in regular Scratch - they use features exclusive to [TurboWarp](https://turbowarp.org/), a Scratch mod maintained by [GarboMuffin](https://github.com/GarboMuffin), so open [TurboWarp](https://turbowarp.org/) and then load the project into it.

### Can I use your work in my projects?

Absolutely!

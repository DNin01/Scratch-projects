# Downloading and Opening

To use the Scratch projects in this repository, you'll need to download them and open them in a compatible Scratch editor. No software or setup is required, other than your web browser, which I'm assuming you already have.

## 1. Download

There are multiple different ways to go about downloading, and you can choose which one you prefer:

<details><summary><h3>Download individual projects through the website</h3></summary>

  This is the easiest way to get going if you just want a few projects from time to time.

  To do this, simply navigate to the `.sb3` file you want in the Code tab and click the download button. For example, to download Drag Across Windows, navigate to `turbowarp` → `proofs-of-concepts` → `drag-across-windows` → `Drag Across Windows.sb3` then click the download button.

  > **Note**
  > You will need to repeat this manually whenever the projects are updated.

</details>

<details><summary><h3>Download the repository contents as a ZIP archive</h3></summary>

  If you want to download everything at once to have, you can download an archive of the entire repository by navigating to the Code tab, opening the "Code" dropdown, then clicking "Download ZIP".

  After downloading the archive, extract the `.sb3` file you want.

<details><summary><h3>Clone the repository with Git</h3></summary>

  Prerequisites:
  - [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (you can also [use GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/adding-and-cloning-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github-to-github-desktop))

  If you want something a little faster, you can use Git to [clone the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/getting-changes-from-a-remote-repository). You can even [ask Git to pull changes](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/getting-changes-from-a-remote-repository#pulling-changes-from-a-remote-repository) and it will do the rest - much more convenient than redownloading, extracting, and overwriting manually just to get updates.

## 2. Run

### Opening Scratch projects with TurboWarp extensions

All of the projects in the `turbowarp` directory need to be opened in [TurboWarp](https://turbowarp.org), as these ones use features exclusive to TurboWarp such as [custom extensions](https://extensions.turbowarp.org/). Once you're on TurboWarp, click "File" then "Load from your computer". From there, select the `.sb3` file you want to open.

<details><summary>If you get an error...</summary>

  #### Check that the extension is supported

  If you decide to use [TurboWarp Desktop](https://desktop.turbowarp.org/), be aware that it comes with a copy of all extensions from the official [TurboWarp Extension Gallery](https://extensions.turbowarp.org/). This means that they work offline but might be outdated. Try again on the website or try updating TurboWarp Desktop.

  #### Don't double-click the file!

  It's super easy to just double-click by habit and be done, but it won't work for these. Unless you have set `.sb3` files to open in TurboWarp Desktop, you're obviously going to encounter an error because it is probably opening in the Scratch app instead, which does not support the TurboWarp features used in these projects.

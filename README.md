# My ✨special✨ [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) projects

I usually share my Scratch projects on, well, [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/), but I also make projects using a modified version of Scratch called [TurboWarp](https://turbowarp.org). If the projects use special TurboWarp features, I obviously can't upload them to Scratch (they won't be compatible), so instead, I made a GitHub repository to share them. Check them out! Some may be just for fun, and some may actually be useful tools that you can use in your projects.

## Opening the projects

See [Downloading and Opening](./INSTALLING.md) for instructions. All you need is a modern web browser.

## License and giving credit

Content in this repository is licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 license](./LICENSE) _unless otherwise stated_.

You are free to use, adapt, and reshare that content, provided that you give attribution (preferably a mention of my name, a link to this repository, and the copyright license in use). It's best to provide attribution both in the repository containing your Scratch project file (if you have one) and inside your Scratch project itself.

By default, it's not possible to add clickable links inside Scratch projects, so just showing the URL which users can manually type in is sufficient.

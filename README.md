# My ✨special✨ [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) projects

I usually share my Scratch projects on, well, [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/), but I also make projects using a modified version of Scratch called [TurboWarp](https://turbowarp.org). If the projects use special TurboWarp features, I obviously can't upload them to Scratch - they won't be compatible with it. So, I made a GitHub repository to share them instead. Check them out! Some may be just for fun, and some may actually be useful tools that you can use in your projects.

## Opening the projects

See [Downloading and Opening](https://github.com/DNin01/Scratch-projects/blob/main/INSTALLING.md) for instructions. You don't need any software.

Just mention "DNin01 from GitHub" and preferably link to this repository and license your adaptations of the content under the same license, and you can go ahead and use these in your own projects!

If you use these in a Scratch project you share on the Scratch website, be aware that Scratch may or may not want users to link to GitHub (I'm not absolutely sure), so maybe don't use these on the Scratch website. Please don't not give credit because of that, though.

# My ✨special✨ [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) projects

I usually share my Scratch projects on, well, [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/), but I also make projects using a modified version of Scratch called [TurboWarp](https://turbowarp.org). If the projects use special TurboWarp features, I obviously can't upload them to Scratch (they won't be compatible), so instead, I made a GitHub repository to share them. Check them out! Some may be just for fun, and some may actually be useful tools that you can use in your projects.

## Opening the projects

See [Downloading and Opening](https://github.com/DNin01/Scratch-projects/blob/main/INSTALLING.md) for instructions. All you need is a modern web browser.

## License and giving credit

All content in this repository is under a [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 2.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/legalcode) unless otherwise stated. This means anyone is allowed to use, adapt, and reshare everything I made in here, under the following conditions:
- You give attribution (preferably a mention of my name, a link to this repository, and the copyright license in use). It's best to provide attribution both in the repository containing your Scratch project (if you have one) and inside your Scratch project itself. For example:
  > #### In your source code repository
  > Credits:
  > - [Video Player Maker](https://github.com/DNin01/Scratch-projects/tree/main/turbowarp/tools/video-player) by [@DNin01](https://github.com/DNin01) (CC-BY-SA 2.0)
  > #### Inside your Scratch project
  > Credits:
  > - Video Player Maker by DNin01
  > 
  > (links in source code)
- License your adaptations of the content under the same license.

Provided those conditions are met, you can go ahead and use these in your own projects!

If you use these in a Scratch project you share on the Scratch website, be aware that Scratch is made for kids and linking to GitHub from Scratch might violate their Community Guidelines (I'm not absolutely sure). Please don't not give credit because of that, though.

## My ✨special✨ [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) projects

I usually share my Scratch projects on, well, [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/), but I also make projects using a modified version of Scratch called [TurboWarp](https://turbowarp.org), which if they use special TurboWarp features, I obviously can't upload to Scratch - they won't work there. So, I made a GitHub repository to share them. Check them out! Some may be just for fun, and some may actually be useful tools that you can use in your projects.

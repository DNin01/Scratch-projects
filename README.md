# My ✨special✨ [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) projects

I usually share my Scratch projects on, well, [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/), but I also make projects using a modified version of Scratch called [TurboWarp](https://turbowarp.org). If the projects use special TurboWarp features, I obviously can't upload them to Scratch (they won't be compatible), so instead, I made a GitHub repository to share them. Check them out! Some may be just for fun, and some may actually be useful tools that you can use in your projects.

## Opening the projects

See [Downloading and Opening](./INSTALLING.md) for instructions. All you need is a modern web browser.

## License

Content in this repository is licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 license](./LICENSE) _unless otherwise stated_. Other licenses include [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 2.0](./LICENSE-CC-BY-SA-2.0.txt). At the bottom of every Scratch project README, the license terms in use will be clearly listed, and you can find the full documents in the repository's root directory.

It's good to provide attribution both in the repository containing your Scratch project file (if you have one) and inside your Scratch project itself.

By default, it's not possible to add clickable links inside Scratch projects, so just showing the repository's URL which users can manually type in is generally sufficient.

If you use these in a Scratch project you share on the Scratch website, be aware that Scratch is made for kids and linking to GitHub from Scratch might violate their Community Guidelines (I'm not absolutely sure). Please don't not give credit because of that, though.

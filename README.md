## My ✨special✨ [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) projects

I usually share my Scratch projects on, well, [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/), but I also make projects using a modified version of Scratch called [TurboWarp](https://turbowarp.org), which, if they use special TurboWarp features, I obviously can't upload to Scratch - they won't work there. So, I made a GitHub repository to share them. Check them out! Some may be just for fun, and some may actually be useful tools that you can use in your projects.

## License and giving credit

All content in this repository is under a CC-BY-SA 2.0 license. All you have to do is mention "DNin01 from GitHub" and preferably link to this repository, and you can go ahead and use these in your own projects! Just be aware that if you use these in a Scratch project shared on the Scratch website, Scratch may or may not want users to link to GitHub (I'm not absolutely sure), so maybe don't use these on the Scratch website.

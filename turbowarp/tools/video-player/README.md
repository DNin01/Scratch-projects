## Video Player Maker Documentation

v0.3.0

### Overview

This project gives you the basic components for making videos and animations that users can fast-forward, rewind, and pause.

It's possible to control the video by using the controls at the bottom of the player or with keyboard shortcuts.

**Open this project in [TurboWarp](https://turbowarp.org/).**

### How to use

The "Progress bar" sprite contains all the essential components to make the video player run. The "Flower" sprite is just an example animation that you can use as a starter. Take both of them with you to start, or just "Progress bar" if you're brave or you know how it works.

Set the variable "Duration" to the length of your video in 1/30ths of a second. One of the scripts sets it to 1,800 (which means 60 seconds) by default, so modify that value to change the duration.

This project works the same at any framerate.

That's about it!

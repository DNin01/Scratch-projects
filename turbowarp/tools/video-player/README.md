## Video Player Maker

`v0.5.0`

This project gives you the basic components for making videos and animations that users can fast-forward, rewind, and pause.

> **Note**
> This video player does not come with audio seeking support, and Scratch has no built-in features to do this. This means that you can't line up audio with the video if users pause or skip unless you make your own way or use someone else's way.

It's possible to control the video by using the controls at the bottom of the player or with keyboard shortcuts.

### How to use

The "Progress bar" sprite contains all the essential components to make the video player run. The "Flower" sprite is just an example animation that you can use as a starter. Take both of them with you to start, or just "Progress bar" if you're brave or you know how it works.

Set the variable "Duration" to the length of your video in 1/30ths of a second. One of the scripts sets it to 1,800 (which means 60 seconds) by default, so modify that value to change the duration.

This project works the same at any framerate.

That's about it!

### Credits

Thanks to the following TurboWarp extensions for making this possible:

- Scratch Lab's [Animated Text](https://extensions.turbowarp.org/lab/text.js)
- JeremyGamer13's [Tweening](https://extensions.turbowarp.org/JeremyGamer13/tween.js)

I also used the [Runtime Options](https://extensions.turbowarp.org/runtime-options.js) extension to make the project work at any framerate.
